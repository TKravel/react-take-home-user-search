# Take home test

A take home test I am currently working on. To save the integrity of the test I will not mention the company or test name regardless of others already hosting it publicly.

## Functionality

Pull users from an API, display users, filter search results by using one or two user inputer modifiers.

### Tech I chose

-   ReactJS hooks
-   React-redux
-   Redux-toolkit
-   SASS
